# dotfiles
These are the dotfiles fo my current setup which I am running on Debian Stretch

I'm currently working on a setup and automation script so I can eventually have my debian setup on a new computer with just a single curl command but it's not there yet. Maybe when I get more time.

## Disclaimer
These are mostly not my dotfiles, it's more of a collection of other dotfiles I found throughout the web(mainly reddit) and put together to make my own system setup. I don't really want to take cretit for anything here but I've also lost track of where I got all the dotfiles from so I'm just sending them to github in order to back them up for myself.
